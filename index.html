                    Introduction: As the old saying goes, "One who works more gets more, who works less gets less". This is usually
                    true as one compares with his/her close friends or neighbors. However, does it still hold when applying to people 
                    across different areas/countries in the world? In this narrative visluzation, we will investigate data on how long 
                    people work and how much they produce, as well as how work/product ratio distributes across the world. This investigation
                    helps us identify the level of economic development among different countries/areas, and may infer some reasons of economic
                    inequality and unfairness across the world.

                            <h3> USA </h3>

                    Comparing the labour and economic data between Cambodia (a Southeast Asian nation laying entirely 
                    within tropics, neighbored by Vietnam and Thailand) and the United States (US), we find:
                    <ul>
                        <li class="font-size-md mt-30"> 
                            In Cambodia, an average worker devotes ~2,475 hours in work,
                            which is <font color="red"> ~710 </font> more hours than in the US (~1,765 hours), 
                            in the year of 2019.
                        </li>

                        <li class="font-size-md mt-30">
                            The extra 710 average working hours (<font color="red"> ~30 days </font>) for Cambodian 
                            workers implies much worse work-life-balance compared with US workers, therefore much less
                            space and fewer opportunities for self-development or recreation before/after work.
                        </li>

                        <li class="font-size-md mt-30">
                            However, Cambodian people do NOT achieve better economy than the US, with their longer average 
                            annual working hours. The average GPD per capita for Cambodia is ~4500$ in 2019, which is 
                            <font color="red"> ~58090$ </font> less than that of the US (~62590$).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        This narrative visualization follows the narrative visulization structure of 
                        <i> interactive slideshow</i>. It compares the working hours and labour productivity 
                        between different countries across the world, followed by an investigation of the labour
                        productivity growth since World War II (for each available country) in future slides. 
                        Through this visulization, I wish to raise the public awareness of unequal and uneven economic 
                        development throughout the world, and hopefully stimulate for the thinkings of underlying reason(s)
                        and possible solutions for economic and labour equality.
