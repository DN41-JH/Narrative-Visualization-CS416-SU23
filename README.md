# Narrative Visualization CS416 SU23
 This is the narrative visualization project fulfilling the final project requirement of CS416 (Data Visualization), UIUC of Summer 2023. As per project instruction, the only libraries used are d3.js and d3-annotation; all CSS stylings other than default are self-implemented, as included in directory "styles/", and no external CSS library is used.
